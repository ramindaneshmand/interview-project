<br>
<h2>Preferred Approaches: </h2>
- Use Mock Servers <br>
- Dynamic way <br>
- Compatible with state Management <br>
<br>
<h2>Decide if you are going to follow the Instruction or you will do in your own way. </h2>
1- if you know to work with mock screens: Check Mock screen and find a LIST_OF_VALUE mock data and complete the relevant GET Mock API <br>
<br>
<h2>Choose one of these approaches:</h2>
2-1 Make it dynamic using constant: Make an state For the created mock API and add function to connector service fetch data for provided entity <br>
2-2 Static way: We can inject state to component directly but you have mention the state name, it is not dynamic and you can not use it for other components if you need different entity. <br>
<br>
<h2>3- Create Angular component: </h2>
Create a new component and show a dropdown Create a service and load LOV from state and let user select it<br>
<h2>4- select one of these validations:4-1 Complete Form field validation only for dropdown </h2>
4-2 Add mandatory validation to all fields <br>
<h2>5- Work with interactive forms </h2>
Complete update for the form.<br>
<h2>6- Choose one below: </h2>
6-1 Play with css: fix panels and add some apace between panels <br>
6-2 Pay with Sass: sass: add a central mixing/function, so we can change font everywhere using one variable <br>
